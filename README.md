## Usage

I didn't publish it as a single theme folder because a few of the pages are added and modified manually, so you should manually create some extra folders in `source` for the new pages and modify the `_config.yml` if you only have the single theme folder.

So i just pushed the whole hexo project for your convenience, all pre settings and boilerplates are included, have a look and go ahead customizing your own blog!

##### 1.Init

```
git clone https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog.git
cd hexo-theme-huxblog
npm install
```

##### 2.Modify
Modify `_config.yml` file with your own info.
Especially the section:

```
deploy:
  type: git
  repo: https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog
  branch: gh-pages
```
Replace with your own repo!

##### 3.Writting/Serve/Deploy

```
hexo new post IMAPOST
hexo serve // run hexo in local environment
hexo clean && hexo deploy // hexo will push the static files automatically into the specific branch(gh-pages) of your repo!
```

##### 4.Enjoy!
